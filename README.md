Introduction:
    In Philippines the weather application is very important while travelling or even making decisions to go outside. In this web application the developer

    will try to get the most accurate weather API that could formulate a weather condition of a specific place. The search bar in the application would help

    to get a overview in weather condition of a searched location. The amazing part is, a user have a choice to use the web application without logging in or

    being a user. But ofcourse there would be nice perks for being a user in the application. There would be other functionality that exclusively for registered

    users only.


Objectives:

    User friendly weather web application with interactive 3d map. It will helps the user to locate buildings, streets, bussiness around the searched location.

    The interactive 3D map is an advanced api from mapbox. It is really stunning.


Overview:

    In the index or the main page, the container div shows a picture of sky with beautiful clouds so it could be connected on being a weather web application.

    The search buttons and inputs also the pictures have hover effects. The API of openweather was used to gather the important data about the weather of cities

    around the world. The 3D map was mapbox API based, it was so amazing, I explored it and try to design and customize my own map.

    There must be a bug in my Final Project, such as some pre cautions in inputting or searching cities that doesnt exist. That's why I will continues to

    CS50 Web Programming to upskill about the web. This journey was so depressing, I almost quit, and feel hopeless, feel cheating sometimes when I use google

    to analyze some errors, to compare my code to someones solutions in psets and labs. But I overcome it, not so perfect. But I improved a lot, I learned a lot.


Language Used:

    Python: So to gather some data, I compared my code in finance pset. I analyze how to fetch some data from the API that I used. This was so comfortable for me

    I already know how to fetch the data from the back-end to the front-end. I also think that I was fast in doing it, and think that I'm good in back-end logics.

    I supposed to have more features than this but I think this will be okay for my final project this time. Maybe in the CS50 web programming I will do more

    complex project that would use more technologies.

    Javascript:

    To fetch the api from the 3D map I use Javascript, I think when it comes in being more interactive in the website, Javascript language becomes the key.

    Javascript also helps me to be more responsive in the client side of the web server. But I don't really have deep knowledge about this. But I'm wiling to

    deep learn in to more javascript like React JS, Node JS , Next Js and more.

    HTML

    This was the basic, I fell in love with html first before any programming language do. This was my first love in internet, I love editing using it,

    In this project the HTML becomes the muscle of my project.

    CSS

    To be honest I'm so weak in this technology, I only based in other designs, aligning divs is too hard for me and I think this would be a problem for me

    in web programming. But I hope in my next CS50 course I could improve my skill about CSS. I think CSS is crucial in being Web programmer. Like me, dreaming

    to be a full stack web programmer in the future.


    Thank you for all the help, David, Doug Lloyd, Carter, and other CS50 professors.

    This was CS50

    Planning to move this in my github

    I will publish this as repository in my github soon
